# Operationalizing Azure ML

In this project we are experimenting with the complete toolchain of Azure for creating and deploying a ML model. For this purpose, we generate and pick a model using AutoML in Azure ML and deploy it to a web service as an Azure Container Instance. Then we will play with the swagger REST API and verify the logs generated in Azure Application Insight

We are using a [Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing) distributed and maintained by the University of California Irvine. This dataset was generated by a Portuguese banking institution classifying which marketing campaigns in the form of phone calls resulted in closing a deposit contract. The dataset records personal parameters of the participants of the marketing campaign like the job, education, marital status, economic situation (loans, owned housing, ) as well as other parameters related to the call and offered product, like date, time and duration of the call, employee number and euribor value.

## Architectural Diagram


*TODO*: Provide an architectual diagram of the project and give an introduction of each step. An architectural diagram is an image that helps visualize the flow of operations from start to finish. In this case, it has to be related to the completed project, with its various stages that are critical to the overall flow. For example, one stage for managing models could be "using Automated ML to determine the best model". 

Dataset + Compute instance -> AutoML -> Model -> Container Instance, enabled logging, swagger

## Key Steps
*TODO*: Write a short discription of the key steps. Remeber to include all the screenshots required to demonstrate key steps. 



### Creating and picking a ML model with AutoML in Azure ML
Once we have an Azure ML Workspace, we should create a Dataset with the mentioned Bank Marketing data. This is a simple and required step to launch AutoML. In the next pictures we can see the generated Dataset.

We now launch an AutoML run as a Classification problem with this Dataset, selecting the prediction column as the last one in the csv file, which is "y". For the AutoML to be able to run, we create a compute instance of type Standard_DS12_v2 and select "Explain best model", so that we are given the list of generated models.

## Screen Recording
*TODO* Provide a link to a screen recording of the project in action. Remember that the screencast should demonstrate:

## Standout Suggestions
*TODO (Optional):* This is where you can provide information about any standout suggestions that you have attempted.

## Future work
This was a nice experimentation project, but it would have been nicer to use my own Dataset to solve a new problem and deploy it to solve a real problem.

Additionally, we would like to investigate the option of automating the whole process by using templates.
